# MIDS_DS266_Final_Project

- This project leverages transformer-based models (BERT, MentalBERT, and DisorBERT) to identify suicide risk in social media posts, specifically on Reddit. Our approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained models using a dataset of labeled Reddit posts, with a focus on differentiating suicide ideation from general depression. We achieve over 90% accuracy across all models after fine-tuning, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain-specific adaptation. The project addresses the challenge of detecting nuanced suicide risk signals in text, contributing to computational mental health by offering a scalable solution for early detection and intervention.

### Abstract
- We present a highly effective way to identify suicide risk in social media posts using transformer encoders such as BERT, MentalBERT, and DisorBERT. We observe that MentalBERT outperforms the other two models in their native form and that all three models improve significantly after fine-tuning, reaching accuracies above 90 percent. To evaluate our models,we utilize metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of their performance. Despite having high overall accuracy, our models struggle to distinguish betweensuicidal intent and general depression.
