# MIDS_DS266_Final_Project

- This project leverages transformer-based models (BERT, MentalBERT, and DisorBERT) to identify suicide risk in social media posts, specifically on Reddit. Our approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained models using a dataset of labeled Reddit posts, with a focus on differentiating suicide ideation from general depression. We achieve over 90% accuracy across all models after fine-tuning, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain-specific adaptation. The project addresses the challenge of detecting nuanced suicide risk signals in text, contributing to computational mental health by offering a scalable solution for early detection and intervention.
